[Althea L1](https://www.althea.net/) is a layer one blockchain specifically for micropayment applications. By dividing the chain between a highly efficient micropaymetns interface and a flexible programmable EVM. Linking these two environments is liquid infrastructure a special account type represented by an NFT that holds revenues from devices performing micropayments.

Althea introduced our [pay-per-forward protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4EKbgShyLw) in 2018, a trustless way of coordinating payments for bandwidth and network routing that is radical in its simplicity and efficiency. This is just one of the many usecases possible.
